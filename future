Possible Future Enhancements:

When having a small number of lines going in, don't need to keep the
upper blank lines.  Will the user ever want the blank lines?


Search string (and blur), allow some regular expressions.  Depends on the
complexity.  Would rather not have to import a special library for it.
Dot, star, vertical bar


Chop left and right blank columns.
